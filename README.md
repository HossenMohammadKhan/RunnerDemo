# RunnerDemo

*AllPlayerCheck Script is checking if any player is alive or not...

*GroupManagement Script is Checking for if any player of the group is collide with main player or single players, 

if they then this script will activate all the array players together of that group.

*All players and enemies have their own script for movement, detect collision, changing colors, and particle system.

*LoadingBar_Loz script is for load a level and show the loading bar(I add some Tips Text too)

* The Attacking system is not perfect, I wasn't able to mark each player for each enemy... All players are trying to attack their closest enemy. (I'm Trying to solve this)

*I added Trigger collision detect to all players scripts so that if any of them collide with the end collider then LevelComplete Panel will be activate and time will be fridge.
